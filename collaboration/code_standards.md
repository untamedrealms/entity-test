# Code Standards

Our code standards are designed to ensure consistency and readability across our codebase. All team members are expected to adhere to these standards.

## General

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Write comments for complex code blocks.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).

## Rust (AI-Agent Core)

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
- Use `CamelCase` for type names.
- Include unit and integration tests for all modules.

## JavaScript (Backend)

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Include unit and integration tests for all modules.

## TypeScript (Web-Based UI)

- Follow the [TypeScript Deep Dive Style Guide](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/styleguide).
- Use `camelCase` for variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for interface and class names.
- Include type definitions for all variables and function return values.

## Markdown (Documentation)

- Follow the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- Use clear and concise language.
- Include code examples where necessary.

Remember, the goal of having code standards is not to restrict your programming style, but to make our codebase more readable and maintainable. Always prioritize clarity and simplicity over cleverness.
